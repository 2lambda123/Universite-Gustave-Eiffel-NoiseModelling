What is WPS Builder ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WPS Builder allows for the creating of graphical process workflows that can be easily executed and reproduced. It allows Web Processing Services to operate through a user interface.

We have developed a version of WPS Builder adapted to the needs of NoiseModelling. This version being very close to the original version, do not hesitate to consult the official documentation : `WPS Builder documentation`_
