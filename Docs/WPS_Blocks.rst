WPS Blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


WPS general presentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) Interface Standard provides rules for standardizing inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for invoking geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay, as a web service. The WPS standard defines how a client can request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled. It defines an interface that facilitates the publishing of geospatial processes and clientsâ€™ discovery of and binding to those processes.


NoiseModelling and WPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NoiseModelling v3.0.0 comes with 7 WPS blocks. With each new version, new blocks are added. Be curious and check out the latest version !
WPS scripts for GeoServer are written in groovy language. They are located in the Geoserver\\data_dir\\scripts\\wps directory.

WPS Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WPS Builder allows for the creating of graphical process workflows that can be easily executed and reproduced. It allows Web Processing Services to operate through a user interface.

We have developed a version of WPS Builder adapted to the needs of NoiseModelling. This version being very close to the original version, do not hesitate to consult the official documentation : `WPS Builder documentation`_
