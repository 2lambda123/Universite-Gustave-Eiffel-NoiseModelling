 * NoiseMap is a scientific computation plugin for OrbisGIS developed in order to

 * sources evaluation and sound propagation processing.
 *
 * This version is developed at French IRSTV Institute and at IFSTTAR
 * (http://www.ifsttar.fr/) as part of the Eval-PDU project, funded by the
 * French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) under contract ANR-08-VILL-0005-01.
